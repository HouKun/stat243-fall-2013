As I discussed in the first class, I expect you to have a working knowledge of R at the level of reasonable familiarity with the material in the first 8 modules of the R bootcamp I held Aug 24-25, 2013. You can work through that material on your own and post questions on the class Piazza site. Section/lab on Monday Sep. 9 will be an open session where Tessa will answer questions you have about R. The bootcamp material can be accessed here on the SCF website [http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/r-bootcamp]. This book is also helpful: Adler, Joseph; R in a Nutshell (available electronically through OskiCat: http://uclibs.org/PID/151634). Phil Spector also has a lot of material on R [http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/spector/Rcourse.pdf] and there is a lot of contributed material on CRAN [http://www.cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html].
